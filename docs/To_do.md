- [ ] Make app deployable
  - [x] Build with jib
  - [x] Run the image locally
  - [x] Deploy to GAR (google artifact registry). Check that it's there.
  - [x] Add admin password through environment variable
  - [x] Deploy an h2 version, NOT prototyping , so I don't have to fiddle with G Cloud SQL
  - [ ] Cloud run...
  - [ ] Deploy a flyway + PostgreSQL version
- [ ] Implement integration tests with ForestInventoryModule at `webapp-tests/src/test/java/domainapp/webapp/integtests/smoke/Smoke_IntegTest.java`
- [ ] Internationalization -> to Serbian.
- [ ] Custom color styling in tables when "Condition" is displayed
- [ ] Customize urls of app (no /wicket for GUI). Research other places where it applies, like logical names.
- [ ] Try to make a REST API with only viewModels. That would make it 100% customizable, using only mappings, and without a need for complex configuration.
- [x] Makefile. -> [ ] Makefile into Readme
  - `make` -> maven equivalent to gradle build
  - `make run-local` -> local h2 no prototyping
  - `make run` -> local h2 prototyping
  - `make run-local-pg` local pg with docker compose
  - `make pipeline` -> from `ci.yml`
  - `make help` -> documents all of the above
- [x] Recognize ConstraintViolationException -> There was an issue with my usage of annotations.
- [x] Recognize uniqueness exception with https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/3.3.0/applib/index/services/exceprecog/ExceptionRecognizer.html
  - [x] Just make the message more friendly
  - [x] Also recognize exception in case BigDecimal is too big.
- [x] Make a @Name annotation that's truly applicable everywhere
  - [x] BigDecimals that are too big on the left side raise a JDBC exception. Too big on the right just get cut rounded. 
  - [x] Look at PetClinic name validation
  - [x] Name in Forest, Condition, Species, with a length param.
- [ ] After creating REST API, create a Vue.js frontend that connects to it.
- [x] Remove all DIALOG_SIDEBAR usages, as it's there by default according to my convention
- [x] Add `gitlab.ci`
- [x] Remove all @Property
- [x] Have packages use groupId name
- [x] Change project names in pom.xmls
- [x] Update readme 
- [x] SemanticsOf.SAFE_AND_REQUEST_CACHABLE on Condition and Species.
- [x] Remove Arborists entity
- [x] Create homepage viewmodel which lists out the Forests.
  - search tab 
  - [x] search -> searches by Forest + Inventory + Plot. Each is required. -> Triple dependent choices is not possible. Can be hacked with autocomplete maybe, but I would prefer not to.
    - [x] allTreesInForest
    - [x] allTreesOfInventory
    - [x] allTreesInPlot
    - [x] allTreesCreatedByUser
    - [x] allTreesCreatedByArborist (filter by createdBy.role)
- [x] Use Paging on Trees `@CollectionLayout(paged=15)`
  - or It is also possible to specify a global default for the page size of parented collections, using the causeway.applib.annotation.collection-layout.paged configuration property.
- [x] Test if ApplicationUser can be referenced by other entities-> It can!
- [x] Add a function so that ForestManager can register Arborists
- [x] Add ForestManager, which has permission to use Arborists functions. -> Already exists as `forest-superuser`
  - Arborists.register() implemented with ApplicationUserRepository. Granting the ArboristRole.
- [x] Read the schema of  the menubars.layout.xml
- [x] Can sort Trees by plot, but not by Condition
  - It's because of implementing `Comparable`!
- [x] Add autocomplete to Plot, in addTree function, searching by id.
- [x] Add security fixturescript to admin menubar
- [x] Make forest.name unique, condition and species too
- [x] Find out if there is a way to define a single X.layout.xml, without placing it in each entity package.
- [x] Add Species and Condition and a `data.sql`
- [x] Create Forest
- [x] Assign Plot to Tree tree.assignToPlot. assignToOtherPlot if already has plot
- [x] Add inventory.id to .columnorder.txt of inventory. Same for plot.
- [x] Add validation for forest.name (and anywhere else where name exists)
- [x] Put metadata behind the details, for Inventory, Plot and Tree. Achievable by copying the *.layout.xmls.
- [x] Make .columnOrder.txt
- [x] List species and condition. CRUD.
- [x] Make a forest fixture script, and run it at startup
- [x] Create inventory and add Plots
